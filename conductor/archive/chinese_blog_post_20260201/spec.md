# Specification: Chinese Blog Post for Conductor-for-all

## Overview
This track involves writing a comprehensive Chinese blog post to introduce the `conductor-install` project, its philosophy, and its practical usage. The goal is to reach the Chinese development community and explain how Conductor brings structured, agent-friendly workflows to any coding environment.

## Target Audience
- **Chinese Developers:** New to the Conductor methodology.
- **Existing Users:** Familiar with Gemini CLI but seeking multi-tool support.
- **Team Leads:** Interested in standardizing AI agent workflows.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Introductory Section:** Briefly explain the "Conductor" methodology and its origins.
2.  **Core Philosophy:** Explain "Spec-Driven Development" and how it optimizes AI agent performance (reducing context noise, providing clear structure).
3.  **Step-by-Step Tutorial:**
    -   Installation of `conductor-install`.
    -   Initialization of a project (`/conductor:setup`).
    -   Basic usage (starting a track, implementing tasks).
4.  **Universal Compatibility:** Highlight support for multiple agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.) and how it decouples Conductor from Gemini CLI.
5.  **Technical Highlights:** Mention TypeScript/Node.js implementation, dynamic template fetching, and local caching.
6.  **Conclusion:** Call to action (GitHub stars, contributions, trying it out).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Language:** Fluent, professional, and engaging Chinese (Simplified).
- **Format:** Markdown (suitable for GitHub README or blog platforms like Juejin/Zhihu).
- **Clarity:** Use clear diagrams or code snippets (placeholders for now).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A complete Markdown file is created at `docs/blog/intro-chinese.md` (or similar).
- [ ] The content covers all functional requirements mentioned above.
- [ ] The tone is appropriate for the target audience.
- [ ] Code snippets for installation and usage are accurate.

## Out of Scope
- Translating the entire project documentation (this is just for the introductory blog post).
- Video tutorials or graphics generation beyond basic markdown/diagrams.
