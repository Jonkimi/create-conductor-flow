# Initial Concept
A standalone command-line tool built with TypeScript and Node.js that brings the Conductor methodology to *any* coding environment. This project, `conductor-4-all`, decouples the Conductor methodology from the Gemini CLI extension, allowing developers to install and initialize Conductor workflows in their projects so they can be leveraged by any AI Coding Agent (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot) or IDE.

## Target Audience
- **Software Developers:** Who want to bring structured, agent-friendly workflows to their projects regardless of the tools they use.
- **AI Agents:** That need a standardized way to understand and execute tasks within a codebase.
- **Engineering Teams:** Who need consistent project setup and task management protocols across different development environments.

## Core Goals
- **Universal Compatibility:** Enable the Conductor methodology outside of the Gemini CLI ecosystem.
- **Agent-Agnostic Setup:** Provide a mechanism to "install" Conductor commands and templates into a project, effectively "enabling" it for consumption by multiple different coding agents.
- **Standardization:** Create a unified interface for project orchestration that bridges the gap between human intent and AI execution.

## Key Features
- **Project Initialization & Installation:** A robust CLI to scaffold the necessary Conductor directories, templates, and configuration files into any project.
- **Agent Installation Scope Control**: Enforces global (e.g., `~/.codex`) or project-level installation based on agent type requirements.
- **Smart Agent Selection**: Interactive CLI to choose your preferred AI agent.
- **Multi-Agent Support:** Built-in support for multiple AI agents including **OpenCode**, **Claude Code**, **Antigravity**, **Cursor**, **VS Code Copilot**, **Codex**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, and **Gemini CLI**, with automated generation of tailored command structures and file formats (Markdown or TOML) for each.
- **Universal Command Interface:** A set of standardized commands (implemented via `yargs`) to manage the lifecycle of tasks and tracks, designed to be easily invoked by both humans and agents.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Cross-platform execution provided by Node.js.
